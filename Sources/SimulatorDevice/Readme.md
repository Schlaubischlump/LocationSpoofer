# SimulatorDevice

This is a simple Objective-C based backend library used to list iPhoneSimulator devices and change their current location. The library is implemented in Objective-C, since it is easier to interact with the Objective-C runtime and private frameworks using Objective-C than with Swift. 

The public header can be found in `include/simulatordevice.h` and exposed the `SimDeviceWrapper` class.
